# InsurTech Case Study: fidentiaX #




# Overview and Origins #

This case study covers a company called fidentiaX (incorporated on December 10th 2018) which brands itself as the world’s 1st marketplace for tradable policies. The basic premise for fidentiaX came about in 2016 when the two founders, Alvin Ang, CEO and Co-Founder, and Douglas Goh, Co-Founder, saw the opportunity to remove many of the barriers and inefficiencies in the current tradable policy market and capitalize on the huge market opportunity.  Life insurance industry giants were generating billions of dollars in premiums each year – and as of 2016, in the OECD region alone, the total market size for premiums was more than US $3.86 trillion dollars.  

The founders of fidentiaX saw this as an exciting opportunity and quickly assembled a team to solve three of the main core problems they saw in the tradable policy market:

•	*Lack of consumer awareness around the financial opportunity to sell one’s policies in the market for a higher cash value*

•	*Current barrier to facilitate connecting policy buyers with sellers due to a lack of a recognizable marketplace*

•	*Reliance on a 3rd party to facilitate cross-border transactions that added another layer of friction and additional cost to the transaction*

The fidentiaX started with a commendable launch with an the initial coin offering of fidentiaX, 52209433.333333336 fidentiaX tokens were sold, raising $1,566,283 USD at a price of $0.03 USD.  The fidentiaX ICO lasted from November 03, 2017-December 03, 2017.  Since then, they seem to be facing somewhat of a challenge with the fidentiaX cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.00208 USD and currently #1369 on the list of largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a total market cap of $218,545.43 USD. Of a max total of 130,000,000 fidentiaX coins available, there are currently 105,000,000 fidentiaX coins in circulation.  

# Business Activities #

The fidentiaX team seeks to remove many of the barriers and inefficiencies in the current tradable policy market by developing a first-of-its-kind secure, transparent and efficient cross-border policy trading marketplace powered by Blockchain technology.  At the core of the fidentiaX solution is the desire to give consumers more optionality in how to handle insurance policies that no longer satisfy their needs to provide better liquidity and return on their life insurance policy investment. Their intended customer is any individual that is looking to buy, sell or manage an insurance policy, lending themselves towards a significantly large market size, albeit geared towards individuals that are move technology savvy and inclined to use a blockchain enabled type service. As a result, the overall market size for their set of customers is large and given their interest in facilitating cross-border transactions, they have the capacity to reach a wide consumer base.  That said, lack of regulatory clarity or regulatory barriers by region will be likely a challenge they face since Blockchain is a relatively new technology and hasn’t proliferated the insurance space quite yet.

fidentiaX is also attempting to provide a better solution to the currently limited and suboptimal options consumers have when faced with new financial circumstances or a change in life stage, and their current life insurance policy no longer meets their needs.  There are three primary conventional options that consumers are aware of and most often utilized:

1.	*Surrendering to the insurer.* By surrendering to the insurer, the policyholder can terminate their life insurance immediately for easy and fast access to cash – often receiving a check within days. However, there are several major drawbacks to doing this. One of the major downsides is that the policyholder then must accept the insurer’s estimation of their policy’s value – this estimate is usually worth much less than what they had invested in premiums to keep the policy active – and pay any surrender fees. In addition, they will likely have to undergo another medical examination, which could significantly increase their annual premiums depending on their health status, lifestyle, age and other factors. Finally, the individual will likely have to ‘repay’ the initial setup and account management fees typically incurred with stating a new policy, effectively burning the money they had put towards paying those fees for the plan they are surrendering from.

2.	*Obtaining a fully collateralized loan.* After the policyholder has funds built up, they can work with their adviser to obtain a loan to pay for anything from college tuition to launching a new business to purchasing their dream sailboat.  This loan approval process is often much easier than getting a bank loan as it uses the cash value of your policy as collateral, but it also carries its own certain risks.  One of the major considerations is that if the policyholder does not pay back the loan or the interest, the interest can then compound and be added to their loan balance. Overtime, this can exceed the cash value of the policy and result in it being ultimately deducted from the death benefit of the policy.

3.	*Selling the insurance policy through a life or viatical settlement.* Typically, this can be a two-four month process wherein the policyholder exchanges ownership of the death benefit to a third-party buyer for a lump cash sum. This typically results in a much higher payback for the policyholder than what would be paid than through surrendering, since the seller will often receive multiple bids versus being beholden to the insurer’s estimation of their policy value.  As a result, the policyholder is no longer liable for paying insurance premiums, and upon the occurrence of a life event, such as their eventual passing, the purchaser receives the death benefit associate with the policy.

Ultimately, consumers were at a significant disadvantage due to a lack of awareness in the inherent risks and drawbacks for each of these more conventional, suboptimal options, and insurers were incentivized to promote surrendering on your policy.  The concept that you could trade in a policy with cash value in the market for a higher cash value was not (and is still not) on the radar for most consumers.  As a result, fidentiaX sought to remove the oligopoly that the life insurance giants had achieved for so long with greater access to fast, transparent, secure and significantly better liquidity options than presently available through an open marketplace.  

The core revenue stream within the fidentiaX business model comprised of annual membership fees, transaction fees (1% from both the buyer and seller), professional services such as customized portfolio builders, as well as model portfolios that generated revenue via portfolio returns (estimated at a potential return of 3.5-4%p.a), mortality upside (in the event of the passing of the original policyholder prior to the maturity of the policy, the policy would be paid out to fidentiaX as the owner of the policy), sales of policies and repurchase option fees.

**Technical backbone**

In order to provide a secure and safe ledger, the fidentiaX blockchain uses multi-signatory access including KYC (Know Your Client), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), and TraceTo.io, a provider of KYC services, that also helps to ensure legislative requirements are being met.

The fidentiaX blockchain is built on the NXT platform and uses three types of tokens including: 1) FDX, issued during the initial token offering, 2) ISX, a platform unified token, and 3) currency representation tokens such as eBTC, eETH, eUSD, eSGD, etc.

As a new insurance policy is listed for sale on the platform, a unique ERC-20 token is generated.  The value of the policy and total supply of the token is 100,000. Initially, fidentiaX was prohibited from selling fractionalized insurance policies on the platform, meaning a buyer could only buy or sell the entire policy (i.e. full 100,000 shares).  Ultimately, fidentiaX did obtain a license to adjust the lot size to allow trading of fractional policies so that users didn’t have to purchase the full policy as a whole – which offers them a distinct advantage to allow consumers of various financial backgrounds to participate in the marketplace in a more affordable way.
 
# Landscape #

fidentiaX is in the InsurTech space and has a significant first mover advantage utilizing Blockchain technology and fractional policy purchasing to monetize and eventually globalize the peer-to-peer insurance policy marketplace.

Over the last decade, the primary advancements in the InsurTech space has included the rise in advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, as well as digital and mobile enhancements to improve transparency and service quality, as well as provide a highly personalized consumer experience.  Now, it’s easier for consumers to get in touch with agents, file claims, see insurance quotes and policy information with a few clicks on their mobile app.

According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), the largest life insurance companies by market share include New York Life Group (6.75% market share), Northwestern Mutual Group (6.35% market share), Metropolitan Group (6.05% market share), Prudential of America Group (5.80% market share), Lincoln National Group (4.83% market share) and Mass Mutual Life Insurance Group (4.57% market share).


# Results #

The business impact of fidentiaX so far has been fairly limited as this is a very early stage company and was limited to Signapore issued policies only as of December 2018. Given their unique use of technology, I do believe they are an important InsurTech company to watch and have a unique solution to offer.


# Recommendations #

With one of their services being better management of insurance policies across a family through easy access of life insurance policies and documents through the cloud and their mobile app, I would recommend that they ultimately look to develop a digital wallet that can allow users and family members to easily keep track of their portfolios and funds.  I think this would benefit the company as it would allow consumers to easily track all of their payments in one place, including insurance payments.  The digital wallet would primarily rely on NFC mobile payment technology and would be appropriate for their solution because it could securely store a consumer’s fidentiaX coins.
